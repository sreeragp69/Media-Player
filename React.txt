==> REACT is a component based Application


components:

            * Create ajs file having a name starts with capital letter
            
            * Two types of components :
             
                 1. Class based components :>     Stateful components

                 2. function baced components :>  Stateless components

                                                REACT HOOK: It a predefined functions and name start with use keyword.

                                                HOW TO CREATE HOOK:-
                                                                    use predefined-function()
                                                                    use state()
                
                State creation syntax:
                    const[statename,statevalueupadtionfunction]=useState()


State: It is used to store values and(Also it has an adv to transfer value) we can share state to child component

Props: It is used to share data b/w parent and child.
